### summary  
```
In this paper we investigate the critical efficiency of detectors in order to
see Bell nonlocality using multiple copies of the two-qubit maximally entangled
state and local Pauli measurements which act in the corresponding qubit
subspaces. It is known that for the two-qubit maximally entangled state a
symmetric detection efficiency of $82.84\%$ can be tolerated using the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell test. We show that this threshold can be
lowered by using multiple copies of the two-qubit maximally entangled state. We
get the upper bounds $80.86\%$, $73.99\%$ and $69.29\%$ on the symmetric
detection efficiency threshold for two, three and four copies of the state,
where the respective number of measurements per party are 4, 8 and 16. However,
in the case of four copies the result is partly due to a heuristic method. In
order to get the corresponding Bell inequalities we made use of linear
programming for two copies of the state and convex optimization based on
Gilbert algorithm for three and four copies of the state.

### summary

Lightning is an important electrical phenomenon, known to exist in several
Solar System planets. It carries information on convection and cloud formation,
and may be important for pre-biotic chemistry. Exoplanets and brown dwarfs have
been shown to host environments appropriate for the initiation of lightning
discharges. In this PhD project, I aim to determine if lightning on exoplanets
and brown dwarfs can be more energetic than it is known from Solar System
planets, what are the most promising signatures to look for, and if these
"exo-lightning" signatures can be detected from Earth.
  This thesis focuses on three major topics. First I discuss a lightning
climatology study of Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus. I apply the obtained
lightning statistics to extrasolar planets in order to give a first estimate on
lightning occurrence on exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Next, I introduce a short
study of potential lightning activity on the exoplanet HAT-P-11b, based on
previous radio observations. Related to this, I discuss a first estimate of
observability of lightning from close brown dwarfs, with the optical Danish
Telescope. The final part of my project focuses on a lightning radio model,
which is applied to study the energy and radio power released from lightning
discharges in hot giant gas planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. The released
energy determines the observability of signatures, and the effect lightning has
on the local atmosphere of the object.
  This work combines knowledge obtained from planetary and earth sciences and
uses that to learn more about extrasolar systems. My main results show that
lightning on exoplanets may be more energetic than in the Solar System,
supporting the possibility of future observations and detection of lightning
activity on an extrasolar body. My work provides the base for future radio,
optical, and infrared search for "exo-lightning".

### summary  
```
We investigate the phenomenology of a dark matter scenario containing two
generations of the dark matter particle, differing only by their mass and their
couplings to the other particles, akin to the quark and lepton sectors of the
Standard Model. For concreteness, we consider the case where the two dark
matter generations are Majorana fermions that couple to a right-handed lepton
and a scalar mediator through Yukawa couplings. We identify different
production regimes in the multi-flavor dark matter scenario and we argue that
in some parts of the parameter space the heavier generation can play a pivotal
role in generating the correct dark matter abundance. In these regions, the
strength of the dark matter coupling to the Standard Model can be much larger
than in the single-flavored dark matter scenario. Correspondingly the indirect
and direct detection signals can be significantly boosted. We also comment on
the signatures of the model from the decay of the heavier dark matter
generation into the lighter.

### summary  
```
We introduce the probabilistic sequential matrix factorization (PSMF) method
for factorizing time-varying and non-stationary datasets consisting of
high-dimensional time-series. In particular, we consider nonlinear Gaussian
state-space models where sequential approximate inference results in the
factorization of a data matrix into a dictionary and time-varying coefficients
with potentially nonlinear Markovian dependencies. The assumed Markovian
structure on the coefficients enables us to encode temporal dependencies into a
low-dimensional feature space. The proposed inference method is solely based on
an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme, which makes the resulting
method particularly efficient. PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities
and, more importantly, can be used to calibrate and estimate generic
differentiable nonlinear subspace models. We also introduce a robust version of
PSMF, called rPSMF, which uses Student-t filters to handle model
misspecification. We show that PSMF can be used in multiple contexts: modeling
time series with a periodic subspace, robustifying changepoint detection
methods, and imputing missing data in several high-dimensional time-series,
such as measurements of pollutants across London.

### summary

Isobaric $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}}=200$ GeV have been conducted at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider to circumvent the large flow-induced background
in searching for the chiral magnetic effect (CME), predicted to exist in
topological quantum chromodynamics. Considering that the background in isobar
collisions is approximately twice that in Au+Au collisions (due to the smaller
multiplicity) and the CME signal is approximately half (due to the weaker
magnetic field), we caution that the CME may not be detectable with the
collected isobar data statistics if the axial charge per entropy density
($n_5/s$) is system independent. We verify this general expectation by
Anomalous-Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD). However, if the $n_5/s$ in isobar
collisions is 1.5 times that in Au+Au collisions, as AVFD indicates, then a CME
signal could be expected with a $\sim$2$\sigma$ significance.

### summary  
```
The chemical differentiation of seven COMs in the extended region around Sgr
B2 has been observed: CH$_2$OHCHO, CH$_3$OCHO, t-HCOOH, C$_2$H$_5$OH, and
CH$_3$NH$_2$ were detected both in the extended region and near the hot cores
Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), while CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_5$CN were only
detected near the hot cores. The density and temperature in the extended region
are relatively low. Different desorption mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the observed COMs in cold regions but fail to explain the deficiency of
CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_5$CN. We explored under what physical conditions the
chemical simulations can fit the observations and explain the different spatial
distribution of these species. We used the Monte Carlo method to perform a
detailed parameter space study. We investigated how different mechanisms affect
the results. All gas-grain chemical models based on static physics cannot fit
the observations. The results based on evolving physical conditions can fit six
COMs when $T\sim30-60$ K, but the best-fit temperature is still higher than the
observed dust temperature of 20 K. The best agreement at $T\sim27$ K is
achieved by considering a short-duration $\sim 10^2$ yr X-ray burst with
$\zeta_{\mathrm{CR}}=1.3\times10^{-13}$ s$^{-1}$ when the temperature is 20 K.
The reactive desorption is the key mechanism for producing these COMs and
inducing the low abundances of CH$_3$OCH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_5$CN. The evolution of
the extended region around Sgr~B2 may have begun with a cold, $T\le10$ K phase
followed by a warm-up phase. When its temperature reached $T\sim20$ K, an X-ray
flare from Sgr A* with a short duration of no more than 100 years was acquired,
affecting strongly the Sgr B2 chemistry. The observed COMs retain their
observed abundances only several hundred years after such a flare, which could
imply that such short-term X-ray flares occur relatively often.

### summary  
```text
Active learning aims to improve the performance of task model by selecting
the most informative samples with a limited budget. Unlike most recent works
that focused on applying active learning for image classification, we propose
an effective Consistency-based Active Learning method for object Detection
(CALD), which fully explores the consistency between original and augmented
data. CALD has three appealing benefits. (i) CALD is systematically designed by
investigating the weaknesses of existing active learning methods, which do not
take the unique challenges of object detection into account. (ii) CALD unifies
box regression and classification with a single metric, which is not concerned
by active learning methods for classification. CALD also focuses on the most
informative local region rather than the whole image, which is beneficial for
object detection. (iii) CALD not only gauges individual information for sample
selection, but also leverages mutual information to encourage a balanced data
distribution. Extensive experiments show that CALD significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art task-agnostic and detection-specific active learning
methods on general object detection datasets. Based on the Faster R-CNN
detector, CALD consistently surpasses the baseline method (random selection) by
2.9/2.8/0.8 mAP on average on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO.

### summary  
```
To facilitate implementation of high-accuracy deep neural networks especially
on resource-constrained devices, maintaining low computation requirements is
crucial. Using very deep models for classification purposes not only decreases
the neural network training speed and increases the inference time, but also
need more data for higher prediction accuracy and to mitigate false positives.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient and lightweight deep classification
ensemble structure based on a combination of simple color features, which is
particularly designed for "high-accuracy" image classifications with low false
positives. We designed, implemented, and evaluated our approach for explosion
detection use-case applied to images and videos. Our evaluation results based
on a large test test show considerable improvements on the prediction accuracy
compared to the popular ResNet-50 model, while benefiting from 7.64x faster
inference and lower computation cost.
  While we applied our approach to explosion detection, our approach is general
and can be applied to other similar classification use cases as well. Given the
insight gained from our experiments, we hence propose a "think small, think
many" philosophy in classification scenarios: that transforming a single,
large, monolithic deep model into a verification-based step model ensemble of
multiple small, simple, lightweight models with narrowed-down color spaces can
possibly lead to predictions with higher accuracy.

### summary  
```
V555 Ori is a T Tauri star, whose 1.5 mag brightening was published as a Gaia
science alert in 2017. We carried out optical and near-infrared photometric,
and optical spectroscopic observations to understand the light variations. The
light curves show that V555 Ori was faint before 2017, entered a high state for
about a year, and returned to the faint state by mid-2018. In addition to the
long-term flux evolution, quasi-periodic brightness oscillations were also
evident, with a period of about 5 days. At optical wavelengths both the
long-term and short-term variations exhibited colourless changes, while in the
near-infrared they were consistent with changing extinction. We explain the
brightness variations as the consequence of changing extinction. The object has
a low accretion rate whose variation in itself would not be enough to reproduce
the optical flux changes. This behaviour makes V555 Ori similar to the pre-main
sequence star AA Tau, where the light changes are interpreted as periodic
eclipses of the star by a rotating inner disc warp. The brightness maximum of
V555 Ori was a moderately obscured ($A_V$=2.3 mag) state, while the extinction
in the low state was $A_V$=6.4 mag. We found that while the Gaia alert hinted
at an accretion burst, V555 Ori is a standard dipper, similar to the prototype
AA Tau. However, unlike in AA Tau, the periodic behaviour was also detectable
in the faint phase, implying that the inner disc warp remained stable in both
the high and low states of the system.

### summary

We present the model of an ultrasensitive mid-infrared (mid-IR) photodetector
operating in the mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) and long-wavelength infrared
(LWIR) domains consisting of a hybrid heterostructure made of nanopatterned
graphene (NPG) and vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) which exhibits a large
responsivity of $R\sim 10^4$ V/W, a detectivity exceeding $D^*\sim 10^{10}$ J,
and a sensitivity in terms of noise-equivalent power $\mathrm{NEP}\sim 100$
fW/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ close to room temperature by taking advantage of the phase
change of a thin VO$_2$ film. Our proposed photodetector can reach an
absorption of nearly 100\% in monolayer graphene due to localized surface
plasmons (LSPs) around the patterned circular holes. The geometry of the
nanopattern and an electrostatic gate potential can be used to tune the
absorption peak in the mid-IR regime between 3 and 12 $\mu$m. After the photon
absorption by the NPG sheet and the resulting phase change of VO$_2$ from
insulating to metallic phase the applied bias voltage $V_b$ triggers a current
through the VO$_2$ sheet, which can be detected electronically in about 1 ms,
shorter than the detection times of current VO$_2$ bolometers. Our envisioned
mid-IR photodetector reaches detectivities of cryogenically cooled HgCdTe
photodetectors and sensitivities larger than VO$_2$ microbolometers while
operating close to room temperature.

The segmented pupil experiment for exoplanet detection (SPEED) facility aims
to improve knowledge and insight into various areas required for gearing up
high-contrast imaging instruments adapted to the unprecedented high angular
resolution and complexity of the forthcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs).
SPEED combines an ELT simulator, cophasing optics, wavefront control and
shaping with a multi-deformable mirror (DM) system, and optimized small
inner-working angle (IWA) coronagraphy. The fundamental objective of the SPEED
setup is to demonstrate deep contrast into a dark hole optimized for small
field of view and very small IWA, adapted to the hunt of exoplanets in the
habitable zone around late-type stars. SPEED is designed to implement an
optimized small IWA coronagraph: the phase-induced amplitude apodization
complex mask coronagraph (PIAACMC). The PIAACMC consists in a multi-zone
phase-shifting focal plane mask (FPM) and two apodization mirrors (PIAA-M1 and
PIAA-M2), with strong manufacturing specifications. Recently, a
first-generation prototype of a PIAACMC optimized for the SPEED facility has
been designed and manufactured. The manufacturing components exhibit high
optical quality that meets specifications. In this paper, we present how these
components have been characterized by a metrological instrument, an
interferential microscope, and then we show what is yielded from this
characterization for the FPM and the mirrors. Eventually, we discuss the
results and the perspectives of the implementation of the PIAACMC components on
the SPEED setup.

### summary

Detecting and localizing contacts is essential for robot manipulators to
perform contact-rich tasks in unstructured environments. While robot skins can
localize contacts on the surface of robot arms, these sensors are not yet
robust or easily accessible. As such, prior works have explored using
proprioceptive observations, such as joint velocities and torques, to perform
contact localization. Many past approaches assume the robot is static during
contact incident, a single contact is made at a time, or having access to
accurate dynamics models and joint torque sensing. In this work, we relax these
assumptions and propose using Domain Randomization to train a neural network to
localize contacts of robot arms in motion without joint torque observations.
Our method uses a novel cylindrical projection encoding of the robot arm
surface, which allows the network to use convolution layers to process input
features and transposed convolution layers to predict contacts. The trained
network achieves a contact detection accuracy of 91.5% and a mean contact
localization error of 3.0cm. We further demonstrate an application of the
contact localization model in an obstacle mapping task, evaluated in both
simulation and the real world.

This paper describes the new QuickFind method in LcTools for finding signals
and associated TTVs (Transit Timing Variations) in light curves from NASA space
missions. QuickFind is adept at finding medium to large sized signals
(generally those with S/N ratios above 15) extremely fast, significantly
reducing overall processing time for a light curve as compared to the BLS
detection method. For example, on the lead author's computer, QuickFind was
able to detect both KOI signals for star 10937029 in a 14 quarter Kepler light
curve spanning 1,459 days in roughly 2 seconds whereas BLS took about 155
seconds to find both signals making QuickFind in this example about 77 times
faster than BLS. This paper focuses on the user interfaces, data processing
algorithm, and performance tests for the QuickFind method in LcTools.

We demonstrate how to explore phase diagrams with automated and unsupervised
machine learning to find regions of interest for possible new phases. In
contrast to supervised learning, where data is classified using predetermined
labels, we here perform anomaly detection, where the task is to differentiate a
normal data set, composed of one or several classes, from anomalous data. Asa
paradigmatic example, we explore the phase diagram of the extended Bose Hubbard
model in one dimension at exact integer filling and employ deep neural networks
to determine the entire phase diagram in a completely unsupervised and
automated fashion. As input data for learning, we first use the entanglement
spectra and central tensors derived from tensor-networks algorithms for
ground-state computation and later we extend our method and use experimentally
accessible data such as low-order correlation functions as inputs. Our method
allows us to reveal a phase-separated region between supersolid and superfluid
parts with unexpected properties, which appears in the system in addition to
the standard superfluid, Mott insulator, Haldane-insulating, and density wave
phases.

### summary

Video instance segmentation (VIS) is a new and critical task in computer
vision. To date, top-performing VIS methods extend the two-stage Mask R-CNN by
adding a tracking branch, leaving plenty of room for improvement. In contrast,
we approach the VIS task from a new perspective and propose a one-stage spatial
granularity network (SG-Net). Compared to the conventional two-stage methods,
SG-Net demonstrates four advantages: 1) Our method has a one-stage compact
architecture and each task head (detection, segmentation, and tracking) is
crafted interdependently so they can effectively share features and enjoy the
joint optimization; 2) Our mask prediction is dynamically performed on the
sub-regions of each detected instance, leading to high-quality masks of fine
granularity; 3) Each of our task predictions avoids using expensive
proposal-based RoI features, resulting in much reduced runtime complexity per
instance; 4) Our tracking head models objects centerness movements for
tracking, which effectively enhances the tracking robustness to different
object appearances. In evaluation, we present state-of-the-art comparisons on
the YouTube-VIS dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact
one-stage method can achieve improved performance in both accuracy and
inference speed. We hope our SG-Net could serve as a strong and flexible
baseline for the VIS task. Our code will be available.

### summary

We perform a joint BAO and RSD analysis using the eBOSS DR16 LRG and ELG
samples in the redshift range of $z\in[0.6,1.1]$, and detect a RSD signal from
the cross power spectrum at a $\sim4\sigma$ confidence level, i.e.,
$f\sigma_8=0.317\pm0.080$ at $z_{\rm eff}=0.77$. Based on the chained power
spectrum, which is a new development in this work to mitigate the angular
systematics, we measurement the BAO distances and growth rate simultaneously at
two effective redshifts, namely, $D_{\rm M}/r_{\rm d} \ (z=0.70)=17.96\pm0.51,
\ D_{\rm H}/r_{\rm d} \ (z=0.70)=21.22\pm1.20, \ f\sigma_8 \ (z=0.70)
=0.43\pm0.05$, and $D_{\rm M}/r_{\rm d} \ (z=0.845)=18.90\pm0.78, \ D_{\rm
H}/r_{\rm d} \ (z=0.845)=20.91\pm2.86, \ f\sigma_8 \ (z=0.845) =0.30\pm0.08$.
Combined with BAO measurements including those from the eBOSS DR16 QSO and
Lyman-$\alpha$ sample, our measurement has raised the significance level of a
nonzero $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}$ to $\sim11\sigma$.

```
### summary  
```
The bright blazar OJ 287 is the best-known candidate for hosting a
supermassive black hole binary system. It inspirals due to the emission of
nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). Observations of historical and predicted
quasi-periodic high-brightness flares in its century-long optical lightcurve,
allow us to determine the orbital parameters associated with the binary black
hole (BBH) central engine. In contrast, the radio jet of OJ 287 has been
covered with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations for only
about $30$ years and these observations reveal that the position angle (PA) of
the jet exhibits temporal variations at both millimetre and centimetre
wavelengths. Here we associate the observed PA variations in OJ 287 with the
precession of its radio jet. In our model, the evolution of the jet direction
can be associated either with the primary black hole (BH) spin evolution or
with the precession of the angular momentum direction of the inner region of
the accretion disc. Our Bayesian analysis shows that the BBH central engine
model, primarily developed from optical observations, can also broadly explain
the observed temporal variations in the radio jet of OJ 287 at frequencies of
86, 43, and 15 GHz. Ongoing Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA) observations of OJ 287
have the potential to verify our predictions for the evolution of its $86$ GHz
PA values. Additionally, thanks to the extremely high angular resolution that
the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) can provide, we explore the possibility to
test our BBH model through the detection of the jet in the secondary black
hole.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to "backdoor" poisoning attacks,
in which an adversary implants a secret trigger into an otherwise normally
functioning model. Detection of backdoors in trained models without access to
the training data or example triggers is an important open problem. In this
paper, we identify an interesting property of these models: adversarial
perturbations transfer from image to image more readily in poisoned models than
in clean models. This holds for a variety of model and trigger types, including
triggers that are not linearly separable from clean data. We use this feature
to detect poisoned models in the TrojAI benchmark, as well as additional
models.

### summary  
```
While static symmetry breaking has been explored in the SAT community for
decades, only as of 2010 research has focused on exploiting the same discovered
symmetry dynamically, during the run of the SAT solver, by learning extra
clauses. The two methods are distinct and not compatible. The former prunes
solutions, whereas the latter does not -- it only prunes areas of the search
that do not have solutions, like standard conflict clauses. Both approaches,
however, require what we call \emph{full symmetry}, namely a
propositionally-consistent mapping $\sigma$ between the literals, such that
$\sigma(\varphi) \equiv \varphi$, where here $\equiv$ means syntactic
equivalence modulo clause ordering and literal ordering within the clauses. In
this article we show that such full symmetry is not a necessary condition for
adding extra clauses: isomorphism between possibly-overlapping subgraphs of the
colored incidence graph is sufficient. While finding such subgraphs is a
computationally hard problem, there are many cases in which they can be
detected a priory by analyzing the high-level structure of the problem from
which the CNF was derived. We demonstrate this principle with several
well-known problems, including Van der Waerden numbers, bounded model checking
and Boolean Pythagorean triples.

We present the results of high-quality XMM-NEWTON observations of a ULX in
the galaxy NGC 4190. The detection of spectral cutoff in NGC 4190 ULX1 spectra
rules out the interpretation of the ULX to be in a standard low/hard canonical
accretion state. We report that the high quality EPIC spectra can be better
described by broad thermal component, such as a slim disk. In addition we found
long term spectral and flux variability in the source using several XMM-NEWTON
and Swift data. A clear anti-correlation between flux and power-law photon
index is found which further confirms the unusual spectral state evolution of
the ULX. Spectral properties of the ULX suggest that the source is in a
broadened disk state with luminosities ($\approx (3-10) \times 10^{39}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$) falling in the ultraluminous regime. The positive
Luminosity-temperature relation further suggests that the multi color disk
model follows the $L \propto T^4$ relation which is expected for a black body
disk emission from a constant area and the slim disk model seems to favour $L
\propto T^2$ relation consistent with an advection dominated disk emission .
From the broadened disk like spectral feature at such luminosity, we estimated
the upper limit of the mass of the central compact object from the inner disk
radius and found that the ULX hosts a stellar mass black hole.

Confused about renovating your space? Choosing the perfect color for your
walls is always a challenging task. One does rounds of color consultation and
several patch tests. This paper proposes an AI tool to pitch paint based on
attributes of your room and other furniture, and visualize it on your walls. It
makes the color selection process easy. It takes in images of a room, detects
furniture objects using YOLO object detection. Once these objects have been
detected, the tool picks out color of the object. Later this object specific
information gets appended to the room attributes (room_type, room_size,
preferred_tone, etc) and a deep neural net is trained to make predictions for
color/texture/wallpaper for the walls. Finally, these predictions are
visualized on the walls from the images provided. The idea is to take the
knowledge of a color consultant and pitch colors that suit the walls and
provide a good contrast with the furniture and harmonize with different colors
in the room. Transfer learning for YOLO object detection from the COCO dataset
was used as a starting point and the weights were later fine-tuned by training
on additional images. The model was trained on 1000 records listing the room
and furniture attributes, to predict colors. Given the room image, this method
finds the best color scheme for the walls. These predictions are then
visualized on the walls in the image using image segmentation. The results are
visually appealing and automatically enhance the color look-and-feel.

We study differential forms on an algebraic compactification of the moduli
space of metric graphs. Canonical examples of such forms are obtained by
pulling back invariant differentials along a tropical Torelli map. These
canonical forms correspond to the generators of the algebraic $K$-theory of the
integers in degree $4k+1$, for $k\geq 1$ and their exterior products. By
integrating these forms over a space of metric graphs, we can associate
canonical (motivic) period integrals to graphs, which can be used to detect
non-vanishing of homology classes in the commutative graph complex. This theory
leads to insights about the structure of the cohomology of this graph complex,
and new relations to motivic Galois groups and Feynman integrals.

Color refinement is a crucial subroutine in symmetry detection in theory as

computational problems from linear algebra. While tight lower bounds for the
worst case complexity are known [Berkholz, Bonsma, Grohe, ESA2013] no
comparative analysis of design choices for color refinement algorithms is
available. We devise two models within which we can compare color refinement
algorithms using formal methods, an online model and an approximation model. We
use these to show that no online algorithm is competitive beyond a logarithmic
factor and no algorithm can approximate the optimal color refinement splitting
scheme beyond a logarithmic factor. We also directly compare strategies used in
practice showing that, on some graphs, queue based strategies outperform stack
based ones by a logarithmic factor and vice versa. Similar results hold for
strategies based on priority queues.

### summary

Grant-free sparse code multiple access (GF-SCMA) is considered to be a
promising multiple access candidate for future wireless networks. In this
paper, we focus on characterizing the performance of uplink GF-SCMA schemes in
a network with ubiquitous connections, such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
networks. To provide a tractable approach to evaluate the performance of
GF-SCMA, we first develop a theoretical model taking into account the property
of multi-user detection (MUD) in the SCMA system. We then analyze the error
rate performance of GF-SCMA in the case of codebook collision to investigate
the reliability of GF-SCMA when reusing codebook in massive IoT networks. For
performance evaluation, accurate approximations for both success probability
and average symbol error probability (ASEP) are derived. To elaborate further,
we utilize the analytical results to discuss the impact of codeword sparse
degree in GFSCMA. After that, we conduct a comparative study between SCMA and
its variant, dense code multiple access (DCMA), with GF transmission to offer
insights into the effectiveness of these two schemes. This facilitates the
GF-SCMA system design in practical implementation. Simulation results show that
denser codebooks can help to support more UEs and increase the reliability of
data transmission in a GF-SCMA network. Moreover, a higher success probability
can be achieved by GFSCMA with denser UE deployment at low detection thresholds
since SCMA can achieve overloading gain.

### summary

In this paper, we investigate the impact of correlated noise on fast radio
burst (FRB) searching. We found that 1) the correlated noise significantly
increases the false alarm probability; 2) the signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of
the false positives become higher; 3) the correlated noise also affects the
pulse width distribution of false positives, and there will be more false
positives with wider pulse width. We use 55-hour observation for M82 galaxy
carried out at Nanshan 26m radio telescope to demonstrate the application of
the correlated noise modelling. The number of candidates and parameter
distribution of the false positives can be reproduced with the modelling of
correlated noise. We will also discuss a low S/N candidate detected in the
observation, for which we demonstrate the method to evaluate the false alarm
probability in the presence of correlated noise.Possible origins of the
candidate are discussed, where two possible pictures, an M82-harbored giant
pulse and a cosmological FRB, are both compatible with the observation.

relevant periodicities, the role and number of which may vary across states. We
address this inference problem by a Bayesian nonparametric hidden Markov model
assuming a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process for the switching dynamics
between different states while the periodicities characterizing each state are
explored by means of a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling
step. We develop the full Bayesian inference algorithm and illustrate the use
of our proposed methodology for different simulation studies as well as an
application related to respiratory research which focuses on the detection of
apnea instances in human breathing traces.

### summary

The interaction between Earth-like exoplanets and the magnetic field of
low-mass host stars are considered to produce weak emission signals at radio
frequencies. A study using LOFAR data announced the detection of radio emission
from the mid M-type dwarf GJ 1151 that could potentially arise from a close-in
terrestrial planet. Recently, the presence of a 2.5-Me planet orbiting GJ 1151
with a 2-day period has been claimed using 69 radial velocities (RVs) from the
HARPS-N and HPF instruments. We have obtained 70 new high-precision RV
measurements in the framework of the CARMENES M-dwarf survey and use these data
to confirm the presence of the claimed planet and to place limits on possible
planetary companions in the GJ 1151 system. We analyse the periodicities
present in the combined RV data sets from all three instruments and calculate
the detection limits for potential planets in short-period orbits. We cannot
confirm the recently-announced candidate planet and conclude that the 2-day
signal in the HARPS-N and HPF data sets is most probably produced by a
combination of the time sampling and long-term RV variability, the latter
possibly arising from an outer planetary companion yet unconstrained. We
calculate a 99.9% significance detection limit of 1.50 ms-1 in the RV
semi-amplitude, which places upper limits of 0.7 Me and 1.2 Me to the minimum
masses of any potential exoplanets with orbital periods of 1 and 5 days,
respectively.

A vulnerability scan combined with information about a computer network can
be used to create an attack graph, a model of how the elements of a network
could be used in an attack to reach specific states or goals in the network.
These graphs can be understood probabilistically by turning them into Bayesian
attack graphs, making it possible to quantitatively analyse the security of
large networks. In the event of an attack, probabilities on the graph change
depending on the evidence discovered (e.g., by an intrusion detection system or
knowledge of a host's activity). Since such scenarios are difficult to solve
through direct computation, we discuss and compare three stochastic simulation
techniques for updating the probabilities dynamically based on the evidence and
compare their speed and accuracy. From our experiments we conclude that
likelihood weighting is most efficient for most uses. We also consider
sensitivity analysis of BAGs, to identify the most critical nodes for
protection of the network and solve the uncertainty problem in the assignment
of priors to nodes. Since sensitivity analysis can easily become
computationally expensive, we present and demonstrate an efficient sensitivity
analysis approach that exploits a quantitative relation with stochastic
inference.

Context. The properties of the population of Galactic supernova remnants
(SNRs) are essential to our understanding of the dynamics of the interstellar
medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. However, the completeness of the catalog of
Galactic SNRs is expected to be only ${\sim}30\%$, with on order 700 SNRs yet
to be detected. Deep interferometric radio continuum surveys of the Galactic
plane help in rectifying this apparent deficiency by identifying low surface
brightness SNRs and compact SNRs that have not been detected in previous
surveys. However, SNRs are routinely confused with H II regions, which can have
similar radio morphologies. Radio spectral index, polarization, and emission at
mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths can help distinguish between SNRs and H II
regions. Aims. We aim to identify SNR candidates using continuum images from
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array GLObal view of the STAR formation in the
Milky Way (GLOSTAR) survey. Methods. GLOSTAR is a C-band (4--8 GHz) radio
wavelength survey of the Galactic plane covering $358^{\circ} \leq l \leq
60^{\circ}, |b| \leq 1^{\circ}$. The continuum images from this survey, which
resulted from observations with the most compact configuration of the array,
have an angular resolution of $18''$. We searched for SNRs in these images to
identify known SNRs, previously identified SNR candidates, and new SNR
candidates. We study these objects in MIR surveys and the GLOSTAR polarization
data to classify their emission as thermal or nonthermal. Results. We identify
157 SNR candidates, of which 80 are new. Polarization measurements provide
evidence of nonthermal emission from 9 of these candidates. We find that two
previously identified candidates are filaments. We also detect emission from 91
of the 94 known SNRs in the survey region. Four of these are reclassified as H
II regions following detection in MIR surveys. (Abridged)

Online misogyny has become an increasing worry for Arab women who experience

systems can assist in the prohibition of anti-women Arabic toxic content.
Developing such systems is hindered by the lack of the Arabic misogyny
benchmark datasets. In this paper, we introduce an Arabic Levantine Twitter
dataset for Misogynistic language (LeT-Mi) to be the first benchmark dataset
for Arabic misogyny. We further provide a detailed review of the dataset
creation and annotation phases. The consistency of the annotations for the
proposed dataset was emphasized through inter-rater agreement evaluation
measures. Moreover, Let-Mi was used as an evaluation dataset through
binary/multi-/target classification tasks conducted by several state-of-the-art
machine learning systems along with Multi-Task Learning (MTL) configuration.
The obtained results indicated that the performances achieved by the used
systems are consistent with state-of-the-art results for languages other than
Arabic, while employing MTL improved the performance of the misogyny/target
classification tasks.

### summary  
```
The main goal of the JUNO experiment is the determination of the neutrino
mass ordering. To achieve this, an extraordinary energy resolution of at least
$3\,\%$ at $1\,$MeV is required for which all parts of the JUNO detector need
to meet certain quality criteria. This is relevant in particular for those
which are related to the energy resolution of the detector, such as the
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to be deployed in JUNO. This paper presents the
setup and performance of a dedicated PMT mass testing facility to examine and
characterize the performance of the 20-inch JUNO PMTs. Its quasi-industrial
size and operation level allows to test all 20000 PMTs intended to be used in
the JUNO experiment. With this PMT mass testing system, several key
characteristics like dark count rate, peak-to-valley ratio, photon detection
efficiency, and timing resolution have been determined at an operating gain of
$1\times10^7$ and assessed with respect to the requirements of JUNO.
Measurement conditions and modes for the PMTs as well as estimated accuracies
for the determination of the individual PMT parameters with the system are
presented as well.

### summary  
```
Weyl semimetals are playing a major role in condensed matter physics due to
exotic topological properties, and their coexistence with ferromagnetism may
lead to enhanced spin-related phenomena. Here, the inverse spin Hall effect
(ISHE) in the ferromagnetic Weyl-semimetal Heusler alloy Co$_2$MnGa was
investigated at room temperature by means of electrical spin injection in
lateral spin valve structures. Spin transport properties such as spin
polarization and spin diffusion length in this material were precisely
extracted in order to estimate the spin Hall angle $\theta_{\textrm{SH}}$,
which was found to be $-0.19\pm0.04$ and is among the highest reported for a
ferromagnet. Although this value is on the same order of magnitude of known
heavy metals, the significantly higher resistivity of Co$_2$MnGa implies an
improvement on the magnitude of detection voltages, while its ferromagnetic
nature allows controlling the intensity of SHE through the magnetization
direction. It was also shown that Onsager's reciprocity does not hold for this
system, which is in part attributable to a different spin-dependent Hall
conductivity for spin-up and spin-down carriers.

### summary  
```
The near-infrared spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) present emission
lines of different atomic and molecular species. The mechanisms involved in the
origin of these emission lines in AGN are still not fully understood. We use J
and K band integral field spectra of six luminous ($43.1<\log L_{\rm bol}/({\rm
erg s^{-1}})<44.4$) Seyfert galaxies (NGC 788, Mrk 607, NGC 3227, NGC 3516, NGC
5506 and NGC 5899) in the Local Universe ($0.0039<z<0.0136$) to investigate the
gas excitation within the inner 100-300 pc radius of the galaxies at spatial
resolutions of a few tens of parsecs. In all galaxies, the H$_2$ emission
originates from thermal processes with excitation temperatures in the range
2400-5200 K. In the high line ratio (HLR) region of the H$_2$/Br$\gamma$ vs.
[Fe II]/Pa$\beta$ diagnostic diagram, which includes 29 % of the spaxels,
shocks are the main excitation mechanism, as indicated by the correlation
between the line widths and line ratios. In the AGN region of the diagram (64 %
of the spaxels) the H$_2$ emission is due to the AGN radiation. The [Fe II]
emission is produced by a combination of photoionisation by the AGN radiation
and shocks in five galaxies and is dominated by photoionisation in NGC 788. The
[S IX]1.2523$\mu$m coronal emission line is present in all galaxies, and its
flux distributions are extended from 80 to 185 pc from the galaxy nuclei,
except for NGC 5899, in which this line is detected only in the integrated
spectrum.

### summary  
```
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly become a global health
concern after its first known detection in December 2019. As a result, accurate
and reliable advance warning system for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 has now
become a priority. The detection of COVID-19 in early stages is not a
straightforward task from chest X-ray images according to expert medical
doctors because the traces of the infection are visible only when the disease
has progressed to a moderate or severe stage. In this study, our first aim is
to evaluate the ability of recent \textit{state-of-the-art} Machine Learning
techniques for the early detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Both
compact classifiers and deep learning approaches are considered in this study.
Furthermore, we propose a recent compact classifier, Convolutional Support
Estimator Network (CSEN) approach for this purpose since it is well-suited for
a scarce-data classification task. Finally, this study introduces a new
benchmark dataset called Early-QaTa-COV19, which consists of 1065 early-stage
COVID-19 pneumonia samples (very limited or no infection signs) labelled by the
medical doctors and 12 544 samples for control (normal) class. A detailed set
of experiments shows that the CSEN achieves the top (over 97%) sensitivity with
over 95.5% specificity. Moreover, DenseNet-121 network produces the leading
performance among other deep networks with 95% sensitivity and 99.74%
specificity.

### summary  
```
This paper proposes a new methodology for performing Bayesian inference in
imaging inverse problems where the prior knowledge is available in the form of
training data. Following the manifold hypothesis and adopting a generative
modelling approach, we construct a data-driven prior that is supported on a
sub-manifold of the ambient space, which we can learn from the training data by
using a variational autoencoder or a generative adversarial network. We
establish the existence and well-posedness of the associated posterior
distribution and posterior moments under easily verifiable conditions,
providing a rigorous underpinning for Bayesian estimators and uncertainty
quantification analyses. Bayesian computation is performed by using a parallel
tempered version of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm on the
manifold, which is shown to be ergodic and robust to the non-convex nature of
these data-driven models. In addition to point estimators and uncertainty
quantification analyses, we derive a model misspecification test to
automatically detect situations where the data-driven prior is unreliable, and
explain how to identify the dimension of the latent space directly from the
training data. The proposed approach is illustrated with a range of experiments
with the MNIST dataset, where it outperforms alternative image reconstruction
approaches from the state of the art. A model accuracy analysis suggests that
the Bayesian probabilities reported by the data-driven models are also
remarkably accurate under a frequentist definition of probability.

### summary  
```
There is a guaranteed background of stochastic gravitational waves produced
in the thermal plasma in the early universe. Its energy density per logarithmic
frequency interval scales with the maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$ which the
primordial plasma attained at the beginning of the standard hot big bang era.
It peaks in the microwave range, at around $80\,{\rm
GHz}\,[106.75/g_{*s}(T_{\rm max})]^{1/3}$, where $g_{*s}(T_{\rm max})$ is the
effective number of entropy degrees of freedom in the primordial plasma at
$T_{\rm max}$. We present a state-of-the-art prediction of this Cosmic
Gravitational Microwave Background (CGMB) for general models, and carry out
calculations for the case of the Standard Model (SM) as well as for several of
its extensions. On the side of minimal extensions we consider the Neutrino
Minimal SM ($\nu$MSM) and the SM - Axion - Seesaw - Higgs portal inflation
model (SMASH), which provide a complete and consistent cosmological history
including inflation. As an example of a non-minimal extension of the SM we
consider the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Furthermore, we
discuss the current upper limits and the prospects to detect the CGMB in
laboratory experiments and thus measure the maximum temperature and the
effective number of degrees of freedom at the beginning of the hot big bang.

### summary  
```
Despite theoretical predictions for a Cherenkov-type radiation of spin waves
(magnons) by various propagating magnetic perturbations, fast-enough moving
magnetic field stimuli have not been available so far. Here, we experimentally
realize the Cherenkov radiation of spin waves in a Co-Fe magnonic conduit by
fast-moving (>1 km/s) magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in an adjacent
Nb-C superconducting strip. The radiation is evidenced by the microwave
detection of spin waves propagating a distance of 2 micrometers from the
superconductor and it is accompanied by a magnon Shapiro step in its
current-voltage curve. The spin-wave excitation is unidirectional and
monochromatic, with sub-40 nm wavelengths determined by the period of the
vortex lattice. The phase-locking of the vortex lattice with the excited spin
wave limits the vortex velocity and reduces the dissipation in the
superconductor.

Observations and models suggest that the conditions to develop lightning may
be present in cloud-forming extrasolar planetary and brown dwarf atmospheres.
Whether lightning on these objects is similar to or very different from what is
known from the Solar System awaits answering as lightning from extrasolar
objects has not been detected yet. We explore terrestrial lightning
parameterisations to compare the energy radiated and the total radio power
emitted from lightning discharges for Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, extrasolar giant
gas planets and brown dwarfs. We find that lightning on hot, giant gas planets
and brown dwarfs may have energies of the order of $10^{11}-10^{17}$ J, which
is two to eight orders of magnitude larger than the average total energy of
Earth lightning ($10^9$ J), affirming the stark difference between these
atmospheres. Lightning on exoplanets and brown dwarfs may be more energetic and
release more radio power than what has been observed from the Solar System.
Such energies would increase the probability of detecting lightning-related
radio emission from an extrasolar body.

### summary

Deep one-class classification variants for anomaly detection learn a mapping
that concentrates nominal samples in feature space causing anomalies to be
mapped away. Because this transformation is highly non-linear, finding
interpretations poses a significant challenge. In this paper we present an
explainable deep one-class classification method, Fully Convolutional Data
Description (FCDD), where the mapped samples are themselves also an explanation
heatmap. FCDD yields competitive detection performance and provides reasonable
explanations on common anomaly detection benchmarks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
On MVTec-AD, a recent manufacturing dataset offering ground-truth anomaly maps,
FCDD sets a new state of the art in the unsupervised setting. Our method can
incorporate ground-truth anomaly maps during training and using even a few of
these (~5) improves performance significantly. Finally, using FCDD's
explanations we demonstrate the vulnerability of deep one-class classification
models to spurious image features such as image watermarks.

### summary  
```
Person search aims at jointly solving Person Detection and Person
Re-identification (re-ID). Existing works have designed end-to-end networks
based on Faster R-CNN. However, due to the parallel structure of Faster R-CNN,
the extracted features come from the low-quality proposals generated by the
Region Proposal Network, rather than the detected high-quality bounding boxes.
Person search is a fine-grained task and such inferior features will
significantly reduce re-ID performance. To address this issue, we propose a
Sequential End-to-end Network (SeqNet) to extract superior features. In SeqNet,
detection and re-ID are considered as a progressive process and tackled with
two sub-networks sequentially. In addition, we design a robust Context
Bipartite Graph Matching (CBGM) algorithm to effectively employ context
information as an important complementary cue for person matching. Extensive
experiments on two widely used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW,
have shown that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Also, our model
runs at 11.5 fps on a single GPU and can be integrated into the existing
end-to-end framework easily.

Nowadays, as cameras are rapidly adopted in our daily routine, images of
documents are becoming both abundant and prevalent. Unlike natural images that
capture physical objects, document-images contain a significant amount of text
with critical semantics and complicated layouts. In this work, we devise a
generic unsupervised technique to learn multimodal affinities between textual
entities in a document-image, considering their visual style, the content of
their underlying text and their geometric context within the image. We then use
these learned affinities to automatically cluster the textual entities in the
image into different semantic groups. The core of our approach is a deep
optimization scheme dedicated for an image provided by the user that detects
and leverages reliable pairwise connections in the multimodal representation of
the textual elements in order to properly learn the affinities. We show that
our technique can operate on highly varying images spanning a wide range of
documents and demonstrate its applicability for various editing operations
manipulating the content, appearance and geometry of the image.

While pretrained language models ("LM") have driven impressive gains over
morpho-syntactic and semantic tasks, their ability to model discourse and
pragmatic phenomena is less clear. As a step towards a better understanding of
their discourse modelling capabilities, we propose a sentence intrusion
detection task. We examine the performance of a broad range of pretrained LMs
on this detection task for English. Lacking a dataset for the task, we
introduce INSteD, a novel intruder sentence detection dataset, containing
170,000+ documents constructed from English Wikipedia and CNN news articles.
Our experiments show that pretrained LMs perform impressively in in-domain
evaluation, but experience a substantial drop in the cross-domain setting,
indicating limited generalisation capacity. Further results over a novel
linguistic probe dataset show that there is substantial room for improvement,
especially in the cross-domain setting.

### summary

The domain diversities including inconsistent annotation and varied image
collection conditions inevitably exist among different facial expression
recognition (FER) datasets, which pose an evident challenge for adapting the
FER model trained on one dataset to another one. Recent works mainly focus on
domain-invariant deep feature learning with adversarial learning mechanism,
ignoring the sibling facial action unit (AU) detection task which has obtained
great progress. Considering AUs objectively determine facial expressions, this
paper proposes an AU-guided unsupervised Domain Adaptive FER (AdaFER) framework
to relieve the annotation bias between different FER datasets. In AdaFER, we
first leverage an advanced model for AU detection on both source and target
domain. Then, we compare the AU results to perform AU-guided annotating, i.e.,
target faces that own the same AUs with source faces would inherit the labels
from source domain. Meanwhile, to achieve domain-invariant compact features, we
utilize an AU-guided triplet training which randomly collects
anchor-positive-negative triplets on both domains with AUs. We conduct
extensive experiments on several popular benchmarks and show that AdaFER
achieves state-of-the-art results on all these benchmarks.

### summary

Software reuse, especially partial reuse, poses legal and security threats to
software development. Since its source codes are usually unavailable, software
reuse is hard to be detected with interpretation. On the other hand, current
approaches suffer from poor detection accuracy and efficiency, far from
satisfying practical demands. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we
propose \textit{ISRD}, an interpretation-enabled software reuse detection
approach based on a multi-level birthmark model that contains function level,
basic block level, and instruction level. To overcome obfuscation caused by
cross-compilation, we represent function semantics with Minimum Branch Path
(MBP) and perform normalization to extract core semantics of instructions. For
efficiently detecting reused functions, a process for "intent search based on
anchor recognition" is designed to speed up reuse detection. It uses strict
instruction match and identical library call invocation check to find anchor
functions (in short anchors) and then traverses neighbors of the anchors to
explore potentially matched function pairs. Extensive experiments based on two
real-world binary datasets reveal that \textit{ISRD} is interpretable,
effective, and efficient, which achieves $97.2\%$ precision and $94.8\%$
recall. Moreover, it is resilient to cross-compilation, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches.

### summary

We have investigated the RE atomic distribution and its magnetic moment
orientation at the region near the surface of DyCo$_{4.4 \& 4.6}$ ferrimagnetic
amorphous films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). XMCD spectroscopy
of the films at the Dy $M_{4,5}$ and Co $L_{2,3}$ edges using total electron
yield (TEY) detection was performed at 2 K and 300 K temperatures, and at
sample orientations ranged from 0$^{\circ}$ to 70$^{\circ}$ with respect to the
magnetic easy axis. The measurements showed an apparent partial decoupling
between the cobalt and dysprosium magnetic sublattices. At RT, the magnetic
moment per atom of dysprosium was below the minimum value expected if all
dysprosium moments were AF coupled to cobalt. At 2 K, the cobalt sublattice
presented a stronger magnetic anisotropic behavior than the dysprosium
sublattice. A detailed analysis of the circularly polarized spectra of the Dy
$M_{5}$ edge, based on the deconvolution of the spectra in their related
parallel, antiparallel and transverse to $J_{z}$ spectral components,
demonstrates that the spectra are composed by dysprosium with different
magnetic moment distributions. The fit of the Dy $M_{5}$ spectra using the
$J_{z}$ spectral components evidenced a gradation of dysprosium concentration
due to segregation at the region probed by TEY. The topmost layer was
magnetically uncoupled from cobalt. At RT, 25$\%$ of the dysprosium magnetic
moments in the under layer were found averaged oriented in the same direction
as cobalt. The expected weak magnetic coupling of these dysprosium atoms to
cobalt would explain the surprisingly lower magnetic anisotropy of the
dysprosium sublattice compared to that of cobalt probed by TEY at 2 K.

### summary

Gravitational Wave (GW) events are physical processes that significantly
perturbate space-time, e.g. compact binary coalescenses, causing the production
of GWs. The detection of GWs by a worldwide network of advanced interferometers
offer unique opportunities for multi-messenger searches and electromagnetic
counterpart associations. While carrying extremely useful information, searches
for associated electromagnetic emission are challenging due to large sky
localisation uncertainties provided by the current GW observatories LIGO and
Virgo. Here we present the methods and procedures used within the High Energy
Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in searches for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray
emission associated to the emission of GWs from extreme events. To do so we
create several algorithms dedicated to schedule GW follow-up observations by
creating optimized pointing paterns. We describe algorithms using 2-dimensional
GW localisation information and algorithms correlating the galaxy distribution
in the local universe, by using galaxy catalogs, with the 3-dimensional GW
localisation information and evaluate their performances. The H.E.S.S.
automatic GW follow-up chain, described in this paper, is optimized to initiate
GW follow-up observations within less than 1 minute after the alert reception.
These developements allowed H.E.S.S. observations of 6 GW events out of the 67
non-retracted GW events detected during the first three observation runs of
LIGO and Virgo reaching VHE $\gamma$-ray coverages of up to 70% of the GW
localisation.

constants are adjusted using high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra of
the Sun and alpha Boo (Arcturus) as "standard stars". Updates to the DR16 line
list, when compared to the previous DR14 version, are the inclusion of

atomic line list, which includes significantly more transitions with hyperfine
splitting. More recent references and line lists for the crucial molecules CO

We carry out a systematic study of the response of companion stars in massive
binaries after being impacted by supernova ejecta. A total of 720 1D stellar
evolution calculations are performed to follow the inflation and contraction of
the star in response to the energy injection and how it depends on various
parameters. We find that the maximum luminosity achieved during the inflated
phase is only dependent on the stellar mass and we derive an analytic formula
to describe the relation. There is also a tight correlation between the
duration of expansion and the intersected energy. These correlations will be
useful to constrain pre-supernova binary parameters from future detections of
inflated companions. We also discuss the possible outcomes of the binary system
when the companion inflation is taken into account. Based on simple binary
population synthesis, we estimate that $\sim$1-3% of stripped-envelope
supernovae may have observable inflated companions. Finally, we apply our
models to the observed companion of SN2006jc and place strong constraints on
the possible pre-supernova binary parameters.

Introduction- This paper mainly describes a way to detect with high accuracy
patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease (ES-AD) versus healthy control
(HC) subjects, from datasets built with handwriting and drawing task records.
Method- The proposed approach uses subject's response times. An optimal subset
of tasks is first selected with a "Support Vector Machine" (SVM) associated
with a grid search. Mixtures of Gaussian distributions defined in the space of
task durations are then used to reproduce and explain the results of the SVM.
Finally, a surprisingly simple and efficient ad hoc classification algorithm is
deduced from the Gaussian mixtures. Results- The solution presented in this
paper makes two or even four times fewer errors than the best results of the
state of the art concerning the classification HC/ES-AD from handwriting and
drawing tasks. Discussion- The best SVM learning model reaches a high accuracy
for this classification but its learning capacity is too large to ensure a low
overfitting risk regarding the small size of the dataset. The proposed ad hoc
classification algorithm only requires to optimize three real-parameters. It
should therefore benefit from a good generalization ability.

A variety of effective face-swap and face-reenactment methods have been
publicized in recent years, democratizing the face synthesis technology to a
great extent. Videos generated as such have come to be collectively called
deepfakes with a negative connotation, for various social problems they have
caused. Facing the emerging threat of deepfakes, we have built the Korean
DeepFake Detection Dataset (KoDF), a large-scale collection of synthesized and
real videos focused on Korean subjects. In this paper, we provide a detailed
description of methods used to construct the dataset, experimentally show the
discrepancy between the distributions of KoDF and existing deepfake detection
datasets, and underline the importance of using multiple datasets for
real-world generalization. KoDF is publicly available at
https://moneybrain-research.github.io/kodf in its entirety (i.e. real clips,
synthesized clips, clips with additive noise, and their corresponding
metadata).

### summary

Accurate pedestrian classification and localization have received
considerable attention due to their wide applications such as security
monitoring, autonomous driving, etc. Although pedestrian detectors have made
great progress in recent years, the fixed Intersection over Union (IoU) based
assignment-regression manner still limits their performance. Two main factors
are responsible for this: 1) the IoU threshold faces a dilemma that a lower one
will result in more false positives, while a higher one will filter out the
matched positives; 2) the IoU-based GT-Proposal assignment suffers from the
inconsistent supervision problem that spatially adjacent proposals with similar
features are assigned to different ground-truth boxes, which means some very
similar proposals may be forced to regress towards different targets, and thus
confuses the bounding-box regression when predicting the location results. In
this paper, we first put forward the question that \textbf{Regression
Direction} would affect the performance for pedestrian detection. Consequently,
we address the weakness of IoU by introducing one geometric sensitive search
algorithm as a new assignment and regression metric. Different from the
previous IoU-based \textbf{one-to-one} assignment manner of one proposal to one
ground-truth box, the proposed method attempts to seek a reasonable matching
between the sets of proposals and ground-truth boxes. Specifically, we boost
the MR-FPPI under R$_{75}$ by 8.8\% on Citypersons dataset. Furthermore, by
incorporating this method as a metric into the state-of-the-art pedestrian
detectors, we show a consistent improvement.

### summary  
```
The surface topography of diamond coatings strongly affects surface
properties such as adhesion, friction, wear, and biocompatibility. However, the
understanding of multi-scale topography, and its effect on properties, has been
hindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture only a single
length scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are
characterized using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness
down to the sub-nanometer scale. Then these measurements are combined, using
the power spectral density (PSD), with conventional methods (stylus
profilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of
topography. The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring
topography across all length scales, especially because their PSDs cross over
one another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger scale may be
smoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements
reveal the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with
characteristic scaling behavior at and slightly below the mean grain size, and
self-affine fractal-like roughness at other length scales. At small (subgrain)
scales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness that is
self-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This
approach of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed
comprehensive topography characterization, and all of the topography data from
these surfaces has been made available for further analysis by experimentalists
and theoreticians. Scientifically, this investigation has identified four
characteristic regions of topography scaling in polycrystalline diamond
materials.

### summary  
```
It is generally taken for granted that our Universe is free of antimatter
objects and domains. This certitude has recently been challenged by the
possible detection of anti-helium nuclei by AMS-02. Should the observation be
confirmed, the existence of nearby antistars would make a plausible hypothesis
to explain the origin of the antinuclei. In this paper we use the 10-years \F
Large Area Telescope (LAT) gamma-ray source catalog to set constraints on the
abundance of antistars around the Sun. We identify in the catalog 14 antistar
candidates not associated with any objects belonging to established gamma-ray
source classes and with a spectrum compatible with baryon-antibaryon
annihilation. We use them along with an estimate of the LAT sensitivity to
antistars to set upper limits on the local antistar fraction $f_{\bar{\ast}}$
with respect to normal stars. We provide parametric limits as a function of the
closest antistar mass, velocity, and surrounding matter density. We also employ
a novel Monte~Carlo method to set limits for a few hypotheses about the
antistar population. For a population with properties equivalent to those of
regular stars concentrated in the Galactic disk we obtain $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 2.5
\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% confidence level, which is 20 times more constraining
than limits previously available. For a primordial population of antistars
distributed in the Galactic halo we obtain new local upper limits which
decrease as a function of antistar mass $M$ from $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 0.2$ at 95\%
confidence level for $M = 1 \; M_\odot$ to $f_{\bar{\ast}} < 1.6 \times
10^{-4}$ at 95\% confidence level for $M = 10 \; M_\odot$. By combining these
limits with existing microlensing constraints for lighter objects in the
Magellanic clouds, we infer that a primordial population of halo antistars must
have a density lower than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}\;\text{pc}^{-3})$ to
$\mathcal{O}(10^{-2}\;\text{pc}^{-3})$ depending on their masses. Our limits
can constrain models for the origin and propagation of antinuclei in cosmic
rays.

Multiplexed immuno-fluorescence tissue imaging, allowing simultaneous
detection of molecular properties of cells, is an essential tool for
characterizing the complex cellular mechanisms in translational research and
clinical practice. New image analysis approaches are needed because tissue
section stained with a mixture of protein, DNA and RNA biomarkers are
introducing various complexities, including spurious edges due to fluorescent
staining artifacts between touching or overlapping cells. We have developed the
RRScell method harnessing the stochastic random-reaction-seed (RRS) algorithm
and deep neural learning U-net to extract single-cell resolution profiling-map
of gene expression over a million cells tissue section accurately and
automatically. Furthermore, with the use of manifold learning technique UMAP
for cell phenotype cluster analysis, the AI-driven RRScell has equipped with a
marker-based image cytometry analysis tool (markerUMAP) in quantifying spatial
distribution of cell phenotypes from tissue images with a mixture of
biomarkers. The results achieved in this study suggest that RRScell provides a
robust enough way for extracting cytometric single cell morphology as well as
biomarker content in various tissue types, while the build-in markerUMAP tool
secures the efficiency of dimension reduction, making it viable as a general
tool in the spatial analysis of high dimensional tissue image.

The rise of social media has led to the increasing of comments on online

informative for users. Moreover, those comments are also quite toxic and
harmful to people. In this paper, we create a dataset for classifying
constructive and toxic speech detection, named UIT-ViCTSD (Vietnamese
Constructive and Toxic Speech Detection dataset) with 10,000 human-annotated
comments. For these tasks, we proposed a system for constructive and toxic
speech detection with the state-of-the-art transfer learning model in
Vietnamese NLP as PhoBERT. With this system, we achieved 78.59% and 59.40%
F1-score for identifying constructive and toxic comments separately. Besides,
to have an objective assessment for the dataset, we implement a variety of
baseline models as traditional Machine Learning and Deep Neural Network-Based
models. With the results, we can solve some problems on the online discussions
and develop the framework for identifying constructiveness and toxicity
Vietnamese social media comments automatically.

Recent re-determination of stellar atmospheric parameters for a sample of

these objects. All stars exhibit pulsational variability with maximum
amplitudes at frequencies corresponding to high-order g modes. Peaks that could
be identified with low-order p/g modes are also extracted for a few stars. We
identified some patters in the oscillation spectra that can be associated with
the period spacings that can result from the asymptotic nature of the detected
pulsational modes. We also tentatively confront the observed oscillation
characteristics with predictions from linear nonadiabatic computations of
stellar pulsations. For high-order g modes the traditional approximation was
employed to include the effects of rotation on the frequency values and mode
instability.

Deep neural networks trained with standard cross-entropy loss memorize noisy
labels, which degrades their performance. Most research to mitigate this
memorization proposes new robust classification loss functions. Conversely, we
propose a Multi-Objective Interpolation Training (MOIT) approach that jointly
exploits contrastive learning and classification to mutually help each other
and boost performance against label noise. We show that standard supervised
contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an
interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a
novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature
representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample
soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify
noisy samples. This detection allows treating noisy samples as unlabeled and
training a classifier in a semi-supervised manner to prevent noise memorization
and improve representation learning. We further propose MOIT+, a refinement of
MOIT by fine-tuning on detected clean samples. Hyperparameter and ablation
studies verify the key components of our method. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world noise benchmarks demonstrate that MOIT/MOIT+ achieves
state-of-the-art results. Code is available at https://git.io/JI40X.

Recent advancements in radiation detection and computer vision have enabled
small unmanned aerial systems (sUASs) to produce 3D nuclear radiation maps in
real-time. Currently these state-of-the-art systems still require two
operators: one to pilot the sUAS and another operator to monitor the detected
radiation. In this work we present a system that integrates real-time 3D
radiation visualization with semi-autonomous sUAS control. Our Virtual Reality
interface enables a single operator to define trajectories using waypoints to
abstract complex flight control and utilize the semi-autonomous maneuvering
capabilities of the sUAS. The interface also displays a fused radiation
visualization and environment map, thereby enabling simultaneous remote
operation and radiation monitoring by a single operator. This serves as the
basis for development of a single system that deploys and autonomously controls
fleets of sUASs.

### summary

Early detection of dementia through specific biomarkers in MR images plays a
critical role in developing support strategies proactively. Fazekas scale
facilitates an accurate quantitative assessment of the severity of white matter
lesions and hence the disease. Imaging Biomarkers of dementia are multiple and
comprehensive documentation of them is time-consuming. Therefore, any effort to
automatically extract these biomarkers will be of clinical value while reducing
inter-rater discrepancies. To tackle this problem, we propose to classify the
disease severity based on the Fazekas scale through the visual biomarkers,
namely the Periventricular White Matter (PVWM) and the Deep White Matter (DWM)
changes, in the real-world setting of thick-slice MRI. Small training sample
size and weak supervision in form of assigning severity labels to the whole MRI
stack are among the main challenges. To combat the mentioned issues, we have
developed a deep learning pipeline that employs self-supervised representation
learning, multiple instance learning, and appropriate pre-processing steps. We
use pretext tasks such as non-linear transformation, local shuffling, in- and
out-painting for self-supervised learning of useful features in this domain.
Furthermore, an attention model is used to determine the relevance of each MRI
slice for predicting the Fazekas scale in an unsupervised manner. We show the
significant superiority of our method in distinguishing different classes of
dementia compared to state-of-the-art methods in our mentioned setting, which
improves the macro averaged F1-score of state-of-the-art from 61% to 76% in
PVWM, and from 58% to 69.2% in DWM.

We focus on the dynamical characteristics for a 2-dimensional $p$-wave
superconductor with open and periodic boundary conditions in orthogonal
directions. Firstly, we show the bulk-boundary correspondence concerning the
topological phase diagram by Pfaffian. The vector of expectations of Pauli
matrixes can also reflect the topological phase for this model in global
manners. Besides, dynamical phase transition does occur in the parameter region
consistent with the topological phase diagram. And temporal dynamical
non-analyticities occur until the parameter changes across the topological
critical point slowly. It is found the dynamics of the excitation behaves
distinctly in different topological phases. Dynamical phase transition behaves
robustly against noise of the lattice until reaching a threshold when the
time-domain localization dominates. This work may benefit detecting topological
phase in dynamical manners.

In a typical multi-label setting, a picture contains on average few positive
labels, and many negative ones. This positive-negative imbalance dominates the
optimization process, and can lead to under-emphasizing gradients from positive
labels during training, resulting in poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
a novel asymmetric loss ("ASL"), which operates differently on positive and
negative samples. The loss enables to dynamically down-weights and
hard-thresholds easy negative samples, while also discarding possibly
mislabeled samples. We demonstrate how ASL can balance the probabilities of
different samples, and how this balancing is translated to better mAP scores.
With ASL, we reach state-of-the-art results on multiple popular multi-label
datasets: MS-COCO, Pascal-VOC, NUS-WIDE and Open Images. We also demonstrate
ASL applicability for other tasks, such as single-label classification and
object detection. ASL is effective, easy to implement, and does not increase
the training time or complexity.

Entanglement witness is an effective method to detect entanglement in unknown
states without doing full tomography. One of the most widespread schemes of
witnessing entanglement is measuring its fidelity with respect to a pure
entangled state. Recently, a large class of states whose entanglement can not
be detected with the fidelity witness has been discovered in Phys.Rev.Lett
\textbf{124},200502(2020). They are called unfaithful states. In this paper we
propose a new way to detect entanglement by calculating the lower bound of
entanglement using measurement results. Numerical simulation shows our method
can detect entanglement in unfaithful states with a small number of
measurements. Moreover, we generalize our scheme to multipartite states and
show that it can tolerate higher noise than previous entanglement witness
operators with same number of measurement settings.

The evanescent wave coronagraph uses the principle of frustrated total
internal reflection (FTIR) to suppress the light coming from the star and study
its close environment. Its focal plane mask is composed of a lens and a prism
placed in contact with each other to produce the coronagraphic effect. In this
paper, we present the experimental results obtained using an upgraded focal
plane mask of the Evanescent Wave Coronagraph (EvWaCo). These experimental
results are also compared to the theoretical performance of the coronagraph
obtained through simulations. Experimentally, we reach a raw contrast equal to
a few 10{-4} at a distance equal to 3 {\lambda}/D over the full I-band
({\lambda}_c = 800 nm, {\Delta}{\lambda}/{\lambda} \approx 20\%) and equal to 4
{\lambda}/D over the full R-band ({\lambda}_c = 650 nm,
{\Delta}{\lambda}/{\lambda} \approx 23\%) in unpolarized light. However, our
simulations show a raw contrast close to 10^{-4} over the full I-band and
R-band at the same distance, thus, confirming the theoretical achromatic
advantage of the coronagraph. We also verify the stability of the mask through
a series of contrast measurements over a period of 8 months. Furthermore, we
measure the sensitivity of the coronagraph to the lateral and longitudinal
misalignment of the focal plane mask, and to the lateral misalignment of the
Lyot stop.

Object detectors based on sparse object proposals have recently been proven
to be successful in the 2D domain, which makes it possible to establish a fully
end-to-end detector without time-consuming post-processing. This development is
also attractive for 3D object detectors. However, considering the remarkably
larger search space in the 3D domain, whether it is feasible to adopt the
sparse method in the 3D object detection setting is still an open question. In
this paper, we propose SparsePoint, the first sparse method for 3D object
detection. Our SparsePoint adopts a number of learnable proposals to encode
most likely potential positions of 3D objects and a foreground embedding to
encode shared semantic features of all objects. Besides, with the attention
module to provide object-level interaction for redundant proposal removal and
Hungarian algorithm to supply one-one label assignment, our method can produce
sparse and accurate predictions. SparsePoint sets a new state-of-the-art on
four public datasets, including ScanNetV2, SUN RGB-D, S3DIS, and Matterport3D.
Our code will be publicly available soon.

We present LCollision, a learning-based method that synthesizes

architecture that simultaneously decodes new human poses from the latent space
and predicts colliding body parts. These two components of our architecture are
used as the objective function and surrogate hard constraints in a constrained
optimization for collision-free human pose generation. A novel aspect of our
approach is the use of a bilevel autoencoder that decomposes whole-body
collisions into groups of collisions between localized body parts. By solving
the constrained optimizations, we show that a significant amount of collision
artifacts can be resolved. Furthermore, in a large test set of $2.5\times 10^6$
randomized poses from SCAPE, our architecture achieves a collision-prediction
accuracy of $94.1\%$ with $80\times$ speedup over exact collision detection
algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, LCollision is the first approach that
accelerates collision detection and resolves penetrations using a neural

detector -- RangeDet. The most notable difference with previous works is that
our method is purely based on the range view representation. Compared with the
commonly used voxelized or Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations, the range
view representation is more compact and without quantization error. Although
there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its performance in
object detection is largely behind voxelized or BEV counterparts. We first
analyze the existing range-view-based methods and find two issues overlooked by
previous works: 1) the scale variation between nearby and far away objects; 2)
the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature
extraction and the 3D Cartesian coordinates used in output. Then we
deliberately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet.
We test our RangeDet in the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). Our best
model achieves 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist. These
results outperform other range-view-based methods by a large margin (~20 3D AP
in vehicle detection), and are overall comparable with the state-of-the-art
multi-view-based methods. Codes will be public.

### summary  
```
Game publishers and anti-cheat companies have been unsuccessful in blocking
cheating in online gaming. We propose a novel, vision-based approach that
captures the final state of the frame buffer and detects illicit overlays. To
this aim, we train and evaluate a DNN detector on a new dataset, collected
using two first-person shooter games and three cheating software. We study the
advantages and disadvantages of different DNN architectures operating on a
local or global scale. We use output confidence analysis to avoid unreliable
detections and inform when network retraining is required. In an ablation
study, we show how to use Interval Bound Propagation to build a detector that
is also resistant to potential adversarial attacks and study its interaction
with confidence analysis. Our results show that robust and effective
anti-cheating through machine learning is practically feasible and can be used
to guarantee fair play in online gaming.

## 70-Revisiting the Loss Weight Adjustment in Object Detection

### summary  
```
By definition, object detection requires a multi-task loss in order to solve
classification and regression tasks simultaneously. However, loss weight tends
to be set manually in actuality. Therefore, a very practical problem that has
not been studied so far arises: how to quickly find the loss weight that fits
the current loss functions. In addition, when we choose different regression
loss functions, whether the loss weight need to be adjusted and if so, how
should it be adjusted still is a problem demanding prompt solution. In this
paper, through experiments and theoretical analysis of prediction box shifting,
we firstly find out three important conclusions about optimal loss weight
allocation strategy, including (1) the classification loss curve decays faster
than regression loss curve; (2) loss weight is less than 1; (3) the gap between
classification and regression loss weight should not be too large. Then, based
on the above conclusions, we propose an Adaptive Loss Weight Adjustment(ALWA)
to solve the above two problems by dynamically adjusting the loss weight in the
training process, according to statistical characteristics of loss values. By
incorporating ALWA into both one-stage and two-stage object detectors, we show
a consistent improvement on their performance using L1, SmoothL1 and CIoU loss,
performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks including PASCAL
VOC and MS COCO. The code is available at https://github.com/ywx-hub/ALWA.

```
### summary  
```
We propose a new mechanism to communicate between fermion dark matter and the
Standard Model (SM) only through the four-form flux. The four-form couplings
are responsible for the relaxation of the Higgs mass to the correct value and
the initial displacement of the reheating pseudo-scalar field from the minimum.
We show that the simultaneous presence of the pseudo-scalar coupling to fermion
dark matter and the flux-induced Higgs mixing gives rise to unsuppressed
annihilations of dark matter into the SM particles at present, whereas the
direct detection bounds from XENON1T can be avoided. We suggest exploring the
interesting bulk parameter space of the model for which dark matter annihilates
dominantly into a pair of singlet-like scalars with similar mass as for dark
matter.

### summary  
```
DETR has been recently proposed to eliminate the need for many hand-designed
components in object detection while demonstrating good performance. However,
it suffers from slow convergence and limited feature spatial resolution, due to
the limitation of Transformer attention modules in processing image feature
maps. To mitigate these issues, we proposed Deformable DETR, whose attention
modules only attend to a small set of key sampling points around a reference.
Deformable DETR can achieve better performance than DETR (especially on small
objects) with 10 times less training epochs. Extensive experiments on the COCO
benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is released at
https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR.

### summary  
```
The eV-scale sterile neutrino has been proposed to explain some anomalous
results in experiments, \textit{such as} the deficit of reactor neutrino fluxes
and the excess of $\bar{\nu}_\mu\to\bar{\nu}_e$ in LSND. This hypothesis can be
tested by future core-collapse supernova neutrino detection independently since
the active-sterile mixing scheme affects the flavor conversion of neutrinos
inside the supernova. In this work, we compute the predicted supernova neutrino
events in future detectors -- DUNE, Hyper-K, and JUNO -- for neutrinos emitted
during the neutronization burst phase when the luminosity of $\nu_e$ dominates
the other flavors. We find that for a supernova occurring within 10 kpc, the
difference in the event numbers with and without sterile neutrinos allows to
exclude the sterile neutrino hypothesis at more than $99\%$ confidence level
robustly. The derived constraints on sterile neutrinos mixing parameters are
comparably better than the results from cosmology and on-going or proposed
reactor experiments by more than two orders of magnitude in the
$\sin^22\theta_{14}$-$\Delta m_{41}^2$ plane.

Ubiquitous unidentified infrared emission bands are seen in many astronomical
sources. Although these bands are widely, if not unanimously, attributed to the
collective emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, no single species
from this class has been detected in space. We present the discovery of two -CN
functionalized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene, in
the interstellar medium aided by spectral matched filtering. Using radio
observations with the Green Bank Telescope, we observe both bi-cyclic ring
molecules in the molecular cloud TMC-1. We discuss potential in situ gas-phase
formation pathways from smaller organic precursor molecules.

### summary  
```
We present detailed simulations of black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) mergers
kilonova and gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow and kilonova luminosity function,
and discuss the detectability of electromagnetic (EM) counterpart in connection
with gravitational wave (GW) detections, GW-triggered target-of-opportunity
observations, and time-domain blind searches. The predicted absolute magnitude
of the BH-NS kilonovae at $0.5\,{\rm days}$ after the merger falls in
$[-10,-15.5]$. The simulated luminosity function contains the potential
viewing-angle distribution information of the anisotropic kilonova emission. We
simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for
the future networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd-generation GW detectors. BH-NSs tend to
produce brighter kilonovae and afterglows if the BH has a higher aligned-spin,
and a less massive NS with a stiffer EoS. The detectability of kilonova is
especially sensitive to the BH spin. If BHs typically have low spins, the BH-NS
EM counterparts are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector
networks, a limiting magnitude of $m_{\rm limit}\sim23-24\,{\rm mag}$ is
required to detect the kilonovae even if BH high spin is assumed. Thus, a
plausible explanation for the lack of BH-NS associated kilonova detection
during LIGO/Virgo O3 is that either there is no EM counterpart (plunging
events), or the current follow-ups are too shallow. These observations still
have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with an sGRB or
an orphan afterglow. Follow-up observations can detect possible associated sGRB
afterglows, from which kilonova signatures may be studied. For time-domain
observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect
more BH-NS associated kilonovae and afterglows.

### summary  
```
Existing works on information extraction (IE) have mainly solved the four
main tasks separately (entity mention recognition, relation extraction, event
trigger detection, and argument extraction), thus failing to benefit from
inter-dependencies between tasks. This paper presents a novel deep learning
model to simultaneously solve the four tasks of IE in a single model (called
FourIE). Compared to few prior work on jointly performing four IE tasks, FourIE
features two novel contributions to capture inter-dependencies between tasks.
First, at the representation level, we introduce an interaction graph between
instances of the four tasks that is used to enrich the prediction
representation for one instance with those from related instances of other
tasks. Second, at the label level, we propose a dependency graph for the
information types in the four IE tasks that captures the connections between
the types expressed in an input sentence. A new regularization mechanism is
introduced to enforce the consistency between the golden and predicted type
dependency graphs to improve representation learning. We show that the proposed
model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for joint IE on both
monolingual and multilingual learning settings with three different languages.

### summary  
```
Recently, text detection for arbitrary shape has attracted more and more
search attention. Although segmentation-based methods, which are not limited by
the text shape, have been studied to improve the performance, the slow
detection speed, complicated post-processing, and text adhesion problem are
still limitations for the practical application. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective arbitrary-shape text detector, named Bold Outline Text
Detector (BOTD). It is a novel one-stage detection framework with few
post-processing processes. At the same time, the text adhesion problem can also
be well alleviated. Specifically, BOTD first generates a center mask (CM) for
each text instance, which makes the adhesive text easy to distinguish. Base on
the CM, we further compute the polar minimum distance (PMD) for each text
instance. PMD denotes the shortest distance between the center point of CM and
the outline of the text instance. By dividing the text mask into CM and PMD,
the outline of arbitrary-shape text instance can be obtained by simply
predicting its CM and PMD. Without any bells and whistles, BOTD achieves an
F-measure of 80.1% on CTW1500 with 52 FPS. Note that the post-processing time
only accounts for 9% of the whole inference time. Code and trained models will
be publicly available soon.
